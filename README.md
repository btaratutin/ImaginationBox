A tool for generating random words and associated images from Google and displaying them in a tiled manner | for helping spark progress during a brainstorming session

Easiest way to understand what it does is to get a copy and run it! Pretty self-explanatory :)

Written in C# by Boris Taratutin & Eric Sprauve

Includes a compiled windows executable (.exe) that you can freely use and distribute - for easy running
