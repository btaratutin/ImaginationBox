ImaginationBox
==============

What:
A tool for generating random words and associated images from Google and displaying them in a tiled manner | for helping spark progress during a brainstorming session

Easiest way to understand what it does is to get a copy and run it! Pretty self-explanatory :)


Details:
ImaginationBox.sln is the visual studio project file that has all the directory structure info you should need

/ImaginationBox/Form1.cs - has the main code for the project

/ImaginationBox/bin/Release - has a windows executable (.exe) file that can be run (if you just want to use the product/distribute it)
